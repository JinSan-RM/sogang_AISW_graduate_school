# Phase 2 Frontend Route and Screen Spec

2026-10-08 WP6/WP8/WP9 supplied-reference member poll layout supersedes the
earlier progress/receipt and full-screen status UI below. The existing notice
detail uses compact rounded cards, full-row blue count fills, a confirmed
choice outline/check and total count. Open unvoted cards save immediately on
option tap; voted cards offer participant access and 다시 투표하기. Closed cards
show 마감/마감됨 and no voting controls. Participant access opens a transparent
bottom sheet containing only option/count tabs and rounded avatar/cohort/name/
major rows. More participants load on scroll; backdrop/handle/back closes the
sheet. No member refresh/ranking/submit/result/progress/receipt or extra status
tabs remain. Empty/loading/error recovery states remain available. Admin
draft previews match the rows without fabricated participant counts. Existing
manual closure and routes remain; absent poll deadline data is not invented or
copied from the notice application deadline.

2026-10-08 WP8/WP9 hardening: web notice create/edit links, including legacy generic-composer admin routes, dispatch to the dedicated notice editor so inline image anchors, deadlines and poll state are managed together. Non-notice post editing retains the generic composer. Administrator dialogs cannot survive authentication-session replacement or accept stale callbacks from an unmounted host.

2026-10-08 WP6/WP8/WP9 P0 poll usability: existing admin notice forms explain
first-response field locking and separate notice deadlines from manual poll
closure. New cards show 작성 중; close confirmation names the saved question,
loaded participation count and immediate irreversible effects. A read-only draft
preview renders notice body/images and card labels without saving or voting.
Save conflicts show the API message and offer explicitly confirmed poll-only
reload; unsaved notice fields/images survive, while the poll draft is replaced.
Editor identity/operation guards prevent late recovery from affecting another
draft. Admin table rows show open/closed/card/unique-respondent counts, refresh
every 30 seconds and open poll editing directly. Members see saved-response
receipts and progress excluding closed/legacy cards; pending selection changes
do not count as saved responses. Existing routes, permissions and poll policies
remain. Evidence: `docs/qa/POLL_USABILITY_2026-10-08.md`.

2026-10-08 WP6/WP8/WP9 P0 poll visual alignment: retain the existing notice
detail route and white/blue branding while using compact flat option rows,
2px result bars, subdued horizontal action buttons and plain named participant
rows with circular cohort badges. `PersonListCard` defaults to its existing
Council style; only poll lists opt into `variant="plain"`. Participant status
is full-screen below 600px with safe-area padding, a close/title/refresh header,
and the existing three tabs; larger screens use a bounded centered dialog.
Total participants remain visible and are announced in the status action's
accessible label. Queries, permissions, independent choices/closure, pagination
and keyboard behavior remain. Verification: `docs/qa/POLL_VISUAL_DESIGN_2026-10-08.md`.

2026-10-07 WP6/WP8/WP9 notice editor: the administrator notice form uses calendar
and clock controls for 신청·접수 마감, with KST save/re-edit conversion. Each
attached image exposes 본문에 넣기 at the last body cursor; the editor shows the
image between editable text areas. 본문에서 빼기 retains its attachment; attachment
replacement/removal also updates body references. Notice detail interleaves text
and protected images, preserves image-viewer access and displays unused
attachments below. Linked council notices with inline images use this body layout
once instead of duplicating the hero gallery; older linked notices keep their
gallery. Existing routes, permissions and poll actions remain.

2026-10-07 WP6/WP8/WP9 P0 attendance polls: `/admin/boards` notice create/edit
uses a controlled editor with independent cards: title, two editable text labels,
own participant count/status, and persisted-card manual close. Default labels are
YES / NO. No date/photo/multiple-selection/poll-deadline controls; the notice's
application calendar remains separate. Voted/closed card fields are disabled;
other cards may be appended. Closing restores only the saved target card and
preserves other unsaved cards; the confirmation explains the target edit discard.
No new route is added. Existing shared post composers omit poll and
preserve backend settings. The existing `/board/post/[postId]` notice detail adds
one white/blue card per poll, single selection, independent submit/revote,
result bars and paginated named participant modal scoped to that card/option.
Legacy formats retain readable results and images.
Council list rows and participants share `PersonListCard`, preserving existing
Council navigation. Poll caches include current account and post; save/vote/close
invalidate detail/results. Admin async completions check editor session/post
identity so switched or unmounted drafts cannot be overwritten. See
`docs/qa/ATTENDANCE_POLLS_2026-10-07.md` for verification.

Kakao parity follow-up: option rows always expose a separate count button, including
before voting; opening people does not change the local selection. Whole-card
status has 항목별 / 회원별 / 미참여 tabs, using the shared Council person cards.
The nonparticipant hint defines the current readable-notice active-member audience.
Each card has refresh; status lists refresh every 10 seconds and offer manual
refresh. Positive ended results show 1위 / 공동 1위; zero votes have no winner.
Administrator copy retains title/two labels only and appends an independently
editable unsaved card. Stable card keys exclude unrelated parent revisions while
including the current card's structure and closure; adding another card retains a
pending choice. Web radio Space and explicit checked/selected ARIA states support
keyboard and assistive technology. White/blue branding and approved binary rules
remain; no route change. Evidence: `docs/qa/KAKAO_POLL_PARITY_2026-10-07.md`.

2026-07-05 override: the AISW policy definition makes the app member-only. `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/password-reset`, `/legal/terms`, `/legal/privacy`, `/legal/support`, and `/legal/account-deletion` are guest-visible screens. Signup/email-verification, password recovery, public account-deletion request/verify, refresh, and registration-option API calls support those screens. All tab, board, post, search, event, FAQ, guide, notification, settings, and admin routes require an authenticated session.

Status: implemented baseline, checked 2026-07-27

## 1. Navigation Shape

The 2026-07-27 implementation baseline follows the current `AISW UI.pdf` and uses five bottom-tab areas plus auth and content stacks:

- Auth stack
- Home
- Notices
- Community
- Participation
- Student Council

My Page/Settings opens from the profile action rather than a sixth bottom tab. Do not collapse Notices into Home without a new product decision.

2026-09-09 Android back policy: Home is the initial tab and the return target for hardware/system Back from Notices, Community, Participation, and Council roots, independent of tab history. An open My Page drawer closes first. Detail screens retain their existing back handlers when navigation history exists; a non-Home tab-area screen with no usable history returns Home instead of falling through to Android exit. Only the unobscured Home root delegates the no-history Back event to Android. The tab-area subscription is removed on blur/unmount and is Android-only; iOS gestures and browser history retain their existing handlers. This policy must be checked after backgrounding/reopening the app as well as on a cold start.

2026-09-13 native compatibility (WP5/WP9 P0): Expo SDK 54 / RN 0.81.5 uses `android.predictiveBackGestureEnabled: false` and the matching checked-in application manifest flag `android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback="false"`. Release manifest validation enforces this setting. Reopen verification must launch through the actual app icon, preserve the same Activity across Home Back and resume, and use the system navigation button or edge gesture. Synthetic Back key events and recreated Activities do not cover this regression. Evidence: `docs/qa/BACK_RELAUNCH_2026-09-13.md`.

## 2. Route Map

2026-09-12 navigation QA follow-up (WP5/WP9 P0): FAQ returns to Council, notice-scoped search returns to Notices, Home-origin day screens return to Home, and notification-origin event details return to Notifications through both header and Android Back. Ordinary event details retain their originating day/history. On shared board lists, Android first dismisses the keyboard, then an open sort menu, then inline search (clearing draft/submitted keywords), before leaving the list. Returning from a post or closing My Page must preserve this priority: the tab fallback keeps a stable focus subscription and reads current route/drawer state without registering above screen handlers. Post detail, post edit, and event detail keep their navigation controls during loading and errors; retry remains available. Header/system navigation does not reset retained tab filters. Verification: `docs/qa/NAVIGATION_FIXES_2026-09-12.md`.

2026-09-10 startup policy: native platforms keep the system splash until session hydration, fonts, and the existing 1,500 ms minimum duration are ready, then hide it when the navigator viewport lays out. Do not replay the same artwork in a React loading view on native, because its different scaling causes a visible size jump. Web retains its full-screen React splash and the same readiness gate. Packaged startup verification follows the final APK build; see `docs/qa/SPLASH_TRANSITION_ANDROID_2026-09-10.md`.

| Search | `/search` | Global search | user |
| Admin | `/admin` | Launch-critical content, account, permanent roster, and current-term dues administration | admin |

The root layout must guard all member routes and must guard `/admin` by role. The UI guard is navigation hygiene only; every admin mutation also uses a backend admin dependency.

2026-09-10 keyboard policy: the native root navigator reserves keyboard overlap so all input routes share the same available viewport. Android releases that space completely when the keyboard hides, and bottom tabs hide while typing. Long forms and report details remain scrollable within that viewport. A native Modal with text input uses its own keyboard viewport because it has a separate native window. Web retains browser layout behavior. See `docs/qa/KEYBOARD_AVOIDANCE_ANDROID_2026-09-10.md` for Android execution and remaining packaged/iOS QA.

Long-post acceptance criterion, clarified 2026-09-13: native multiline fields retain their existing minimum heights and grow only to 240 points; longer content scrolls inside the field. The whole writing form also scrolls, and Android movement at a body boundary continues through the outer form so Register remains reachable with the keyboard open or hidden. Android uses a bounded nested ScrollView around the naturally sized input; iOS caps its native scrolling TextInput to preserve caret behavior. Single-line and web layout are unchanged. APK 9 passes the general resource composer's Android emulator checks; physical Android and iOS runtime checks remain Phase 5 QA. See `docs/qa/POST_BODY_NESTED_SCROLL_2026-09-13.md` for implementation and evidence; the preceding expanded-body investigation is retained in `docs/qa/LONG_POST_SCROLL_RECHECK_2026-09-13.md`.

## 3. Home Screen Requirements

2026-10-07 Home network error consolidation (WP9 P0): if any active Home board, banner, notice, event, album or notification-badge request fails with a connection error or timeout, retain the greeting/header and show one centered network-error state on a white content background instead of rendering individual sections. Retry refreshes all enabled Home requests; successful recovery restores the sections. HTTP response errors retain their existing section-specific behavior.

2026-10-07 calendar bottom spacing (WP9 P0): schedule rows retain an 8px gap between rows, but the final row has no bottom margin. The card's 14px padding alone provides the bottom inset, scaled with the existing calendar dimensions.

2026-10-06 calendar design unification (WP9 P0): all month grids use the Home calendar card, navigation, weekday/date typography and selected-day/today styling through `components/CalendarMonth.tsx`. Activity-certification and mutual-aid date pickers (including their shared edit flows) and administrator event start/end pickers render the same month grid without Home event dots, category chips or event details. Preserve each form’s date bounds, stored date format and administrator time selection. The change unifies appearance only: month navigation uses `YYYY년 M월` with the existing buttons, and no swipe behavior is added to form calendars. Home retains its existing swipe behavior.

2026-10-06 user design update (WP9 P0): remove the decorative emoji images beside the greeting name, `행사 사진첩`, and `동문회 주소록` headings. Keep their text and existing actions. The Home schedule calendar month heading uses `YYYY년 M월` (for example, `2026년 10월`), without zero-padding the month. When the selected date has no events, omit the zero-count label and display `등록된 일정이 없어요` centered across the calendar content width below the date header (8px gap, 24px vertical padding, regular 13px/16px text, `#A6ACB7`); dimensions follow the existing calendar scale.

Sections:

- Quick menu for P0 flows.
- Latest two notices across every active notice board, ordered by creation time without pin priority.
- Upcoming schedule.
- Recent community posts.
- Final `동문회 주소록` entry that always opens the fixed Rembr directory URL `https://app.rmbr.in/SPbmZjUxRzb`; board metadata and administrator external-link settings do not override the Home destination.

Quick menu:

- Academic notices
- Event notices
- Calendar
- Lecture reviews
- Exam archive
- Suggestions

The Home schedule card changes its displayed month and `GET /events` range in place when the previous/next arrows are pressed. Empty upcoming-schedule copy is not interactive. API datetime values are explicit UTC strings ending in `Z`, while schedule detail/admin inputs and Home calendar placement display the corresponding KST value without changing the stored instant. Multi-day events mark every KST calendar date from `start_at` through `end_at`, inclusive, in the Home card; day routes and D-day notification dispatch rely on the same KST boundary behavior from the events API. A day route opened from the Home schedule returns directly to the existing Home tab when its header back control is pressed instead of popping the hidden events stack. An event detail opened from Notifications carries an event-detail-only `returnTo` whose allowlist contains only the Notifications root; header Back returns to that mounted list before considering history. Event details opened from Home, day, or admin carry no such value and retain history Back with the Home fallback for direct entry. Post-detail, Home day-route, and My Page return contracts remain independent and unchanged.

QA 201: Standalone event-list and full-calendar screens are not part of the final product IA because Home already owns the monthly schedule. Existing `/events` deep links redirect to Home, while Home dates open the retained day route and event notifications open their specific detail directly. The unlinked all-boards and hardcoded guide-placeholder screens are also removed from the route tree; day/detail, FAQ, Notifications, Settings, and every admin management screen remain available.

QA 161: Home, Notices, and shared board lists refresh through native pull gestures while retaining cached content, current filters/search, and scroll-rendering keys. Protected media access URLs do not refresh on a timer; `MediaImage` and `MediaImageBackground` explicitly refresh them after an image load error. Notification delivery and bootstrap refresh continue independently of the removed Home badge poll.

2026-09-11 loading and mobile presentation: Home uses one initial-loading spinner with text placeholders for unresolved sections. Its pull-to-refresh spinner is suppressed during initial loading. Notices likewise suppresses pull and pagination spinners while the initial list loader is visible, and suppresses pagination loading during first-page refresh. The Home banner viewport clips adjacent pages, including when multiple banners are registered. System status-bar icons use dark styling in the root navigator, Expo configuration, and Android app/splash themes. Android source and mobile-web evidence: `docs/qa/MOBILE_POLISH_2026-09-11.md`.

QA 189: Selecting `전체`, `학사공지`, `행사공지`, or `기타공지` on the Notices root immediately keeps that filter selected and refetches both the board registry and notice posts, so newly published notices appear without a manual pull-to-refresh.

QA 173/188: Explicitly pressing any Home, Notices, Community, Participation, or Council bottom tab always navigates to that tab root, including when the same tab is already active or a detail route only makes it appear active. Notices, Community, and Participation recreate their product defaults at the top of the list: `전체`, `행사 사진첩`, or `동아리 > 안내`, respectively. Home opens its main screen and Council opens its menu list. Header/Android Back from detail routes and programmatic My Page returns do not emit this reset and continue preserving the mounted list state described below.

## 4. Board List Screen Requirements

2026-10-06 album design update (WP5/WP9 P0): the album detail hero displays a current/total image counter (`1 / 2`) for real images, including `1 / 1` for a single image, and updates with arrows, swipes and thumbnail selection. Place it 17px from the right/bottom edges, with 40% black background, 999px radius, 4px/10px padding and white regular 12px/14px text. The overlay does not intercept photo gestures; image-free placeholders have no counter.

Community tab opens the `event-album` board when available and exposes `행사 사진첩 / 자료공유` as section tabs. A photo-album post accepts 1-20 images in total across create and edit. Each picker invocation exposes only the remaining slots (for example, an existing 19-image post can select one more), disables image addition at 20, and retains successful uploads in selection order when another selected image fails. Existing legacy posts above the limit are not modified automatically and must be reduced to 20 images or fewer before an edit can be saved. Every image still uses the server's 10 MiB per-file limit. Resource sharing offers `강의후기`, `시험족보`, `종합시험`, and `졸업논문`; `graduation-thesis` is a member-writable resource board. Exam-archive list rows show the author cohort/name alongside the post date, while lecture-review and suggestion anonymity remains unchanged. The resource post edit screen exposes a board picker limited to these active resource boards, and moving a post preserves its existing detail URL and related content. After a move, the target resource board is authoritative for the post tag across the resource list, post detail, and My Activity, so a stale stored category must never override the target board label. The `comprehensive-exam` and `graduation-thesis` detail more menus omit the author-block action while preserving report and owner actions; existing blocks and block-based filtering remain global. As of 2026-09-29 the app has no event screens at all: `/events`, `/events/[eventId]`, and `/events/day/[date]` were removed along with their route helpers. The Home calendar is the only place events appear. Selecting a date expands that day's schedule inside the card, and a schedule row is pressable only when the event has a linked notice — it then opens that notice and shows a chevron; without a link the row has no chevron and does not respond. Event notifications follow the same rule and simply mark themselves read when there is nothing to open.

Participation activity certification uses the existing source-post selection sheet instead of free-text activity names and loads every published page of its paired guide board (`club-promo`, `study-recruit`, or `networking-programs`). Per the 2026-09-17 user correction (WP5/WP9 P0), the picker offers every published, non-deleted post on that board whose `metadata.operation_status` is not `ended`, using its ID and current title, in the same order returned by the guide API. As of 2026-09-28 this applies to all three groups, so study and networking no longer stop at the first page or skip the operation filter, and the networking picker no longer falls back to the `alumni-directory` external-link board. The picker requests `operation_status=active` so the server does the filtering; the client repeats the new-key check as a fallback for a backend that predates the parameter. No fixed club-name list, name-prefix matching, or title-based deduplication may exclude newly registered or renamed clubs; this supersedes the previous seven-club restriction. All historical club posts and existing certification links remain readable and unchanged. List/detail tags prefer the API's canonical `activity_source_title`, then use stored category or historical metadata only as a fallback. Renaming a guide updates existing certification tags, while retiring it removes it from new choices but preserves the last official name on linked history. This behavior does not change the current UI structure, styling, or copy.

The participation club and networking guide lists are backed by `club-promo` and `networking-programs`. Only admins see their create entry points. Create/edit requires a representative image and an HTTP(S) participation URL; the first image attachment is managed in a dedicated representative-image section and is used only by list thumbnails. Administrators manage every later image in a separate detail-image section, and detail renders those images in stored order below the body without rendering the representative image. Replacing the representative image preserves all detail images and unrelated attachments. Detail binds the `가입 신청` or `참가 신청` button to the managed URL. Participation URLs are CTA-only: legacy body lines explicitly labeled `참여 링크`, `가입 링크`, or `신청 링크` are omitted from the displayed body and surfaced as the CTA metadata instead, while unrelated body URLs remain ordinary content.

Board and post back navigation never uses the hidden `/(tabs)/boards` screen as a user-facing destination. A post opened from a stateful app list carries a validated internal `returnTo`; a newly created ordinary post carries the same validated list target and source board into its result detail. Header back and Android hardware back navigate to the already-mounted list screen, preserving participation section tabs, board filters, search/sort state, and scroll position. Allowed return targets are limited to the app's home, notice, community, participation, council, search, notification, My Activity, and positive board-ID routes. This applies consistently to study, club, networking, notices, community, search, notification, and My Activity detail entry. Without a valid `returnTo`, normal history is used; a directly opened post with no usable history falls back to a valid recorded `fromBoardId` list when present, otherwise to the post board's product hub. Leaving a standalone board returns to its product hub, while legacy community boards such as `community-major` return to Home because they are entered there. In the cohort-leader and past-council boards, header Back and Android hardware Back both close an open in-screen profile before leaving the board.

2026-10-07 override (one stack per bottom tab, see `PLAN.md`): board, post, create/edit, search, notifications, FAQ, and settings routes now live in the shared group `app/(tabs)/(home,notices,community,participation,council)/`, so each tab pushes them onto its own stack and the screen underneath is the screen the user came from. Header Back, Android hardware Back, iOS edge swipe, and browser Back therefore pop to that previous screen first; `returnTo`, `fromBoardId`, and the product-hub fallback above apply only when there is no screen underneath (web refresh, direct link). Leaving a standalone board also pops to the screen it was opened from (for example Home's popular-post header returns to Home). Tab presses and tab-root links switch tabs through `navigateToTabRoot`, which empties that tab's stack. In-screen back states listed above, plus post menus/sheets and the create date picker/completion screen, also consume the iOS swipe before the screen is popped.

Successful post deletion follows the same validated origin resolution after refreshing affected lists and dismissing the confirmation/menu. An explicit standalone `/board/[boardId]` return target uses `dismissTo` so the existing board list is restored rather than pushed again. My Activity, Home album/popular, and shared post/feed caches are invalidated before returning; deletion failure preserves the current screen for retry. Evidence: `docs/qa/MOBILE_POLISH_2026-09-11.md`.

Study recruitment is backed by `study-recruit` and remains writable by every authenticated member, including recruitment status and contact metadata.

Participation search is available only on the `활동 인증` lists for clubs, study groups, and networking, including empty lists. Club/networking `안내` and study `모집` have no search entry point, including the unavailable-board fallback. The header search control opens the existing board-scoped search input, hides the primary group tabs, and keeps the guide/recruitment and certification chips visible. Submitting searches the title, body, and displayed activity badge of posts in the current certification board, excluding author names and participant metadata for every role; a name written in searchable text can still match. Club badge search follows the displayed current source title, then the specific category or legacy activity-name fallback, including retired club history. Networking searches its category badge. Study cards have no badge and retain title/body search. Tag matching is applied before pagination and result totals. Closing search clears the keyword. Switching to a different participation board also closes search and clears both the draft and submitted keyword. Community search retains its existing behavior.

The shared post create/edit route keys its form instance by the validated route `boardId`, `postId`, and `category`. Per the 2026-09-17 user correction (WP5/WP9), leaving a new-post route unmounts its form even when the hidden board tab retains the route. Returning to the same create route starts a fresh form with no abandoned title, content, attachments, or local selections. A valid existing-post edit is not discarded solely on focus loss; in-form overlays and file pickers retain the current writing session. Opening a new post from a board list closes its search and clears both draft and submitted search text while preserving the selected board/category. Detail-view return continues preserving the list search state. Entering a different board, post, or category therefore starts with that destination's title, fields, attachments, and local selection state instead of reusing another board's draft. Changing the board from the picker inside an already-mounted form remains an in-form edit and does not remount the draft. Existing validated `returnTo`, header Back, Android hardware Back, and direct-entry fallback behavior remain unchanged.

2026-09-21 board change reset (WP5/WP9): changing the board inside a mounted form still does not remount the route, but it now discards the draft after an explicit confirmation (`Screen/Common/BoardChangeConfirmModal`: `게시판을 변경하시겠어요? / 작성 중인 내용이 모두 사라져요.` with `취소` and `변경`). This supersedes the earlier rule that a board switch silently preserved the draft, because each board asks for different fields. Re-picking the current board is a no-op. On create, a form with nothing written yet switches without a prompt, and confirming resets it to empty — title, content, attachments, participants, activity source and evidence. Per the 2026-09-22 user correction the post edit screen behaves the same way: it always prompts, because a saved post always has content to lose, and confirming clears the form rather than reverting to the saved post. Saving after a cleared board change therefore replaces the post's content, which is the intended flow for moving a post between resource boards that ask for different fields. The confirm dialog reuses the `DiscardWriteModal` component, whose card and buttons are identical to `Screen/Common/DiscardWriteModal`.

2026-09-21 user request (WP5/WP9): the create route's `boardId` is optional. Opening create from an aggregated list that spans several boards (Community > 자료공유 > `전체`, feed mode `resources`) omits `boardId` and passes `boardGroup=<board category>` instead, so the form starts with no board chosen and shows the `게시판을 선택하세요` placeholder rather than inheriting the last visited board. Opening create from a specific filter (`강의후기`, `시험족보`, and the other resource boards) keeps passing that board's `boardId` and preselects it. When `boardId` is absent, the picker lists the boards of the `boardGroup` category. Submitting without a chosen board is blocked at the same validation step as the other required fields: the select gets the shared 1.5px #D64545 error border and the `필수 항목을 모두 입력해주세요` toast. The picker itself is the shared bottom sheet used by the club and mutual-aid selectors instead of the previous inline dropdown; `returnTo` and form-instance keying are unchanged.
The common post edit screen always shows persistent `제목` and `내용` labels above their inputs so existing values never obscure each field's purpose; these labels do not depend on board lookup or slug detection.
The recruitment list follows the approved Figma text-row layout: status pill, title, up to two preview lines, and `cohort + author · YY.MM.DD(weekday)`. It does not use the image-heavy club/networking guide card and does not show reaction counts in the list.

Club, study, and networking activity certification remains available to every authenticated member. The create and edit forms keep `활동 사진` and `활동 소감` labels visible independently of their current values. Their activity calendars allow only KST today and past dates, disable navigation beyond the current KST month, and repeat the same future-date validation before submission; this maximum-date rule does not apply to non-certification calendars such as mutual aid. The create flow supports multiple image previews, activity date, required account, and participant inputs, followed by a dedicated completion state. Their single shared subsidy-participant picker searches the independent full student roster by name for the current activity board; it never queries member accounts or auto-selects the author. Results hide the student number, show cohort/name and major, and use only `#212429` black for current-board paid (`ALL` or matching `ONCE`) and `#8A919C` gray for current-board unpaid. Both colors remain selectable, and search caching includes the board ID. Activity-certification detail uses the same current-board black/gray rule for roster-linked participant chips; legacy name-only snapshots remain black because their current payment state cannot be resolved. The edit flow reuses the same calendar and roster picker and hydrates current participant IDs or historical name-only chips, source post, and attachments. Per the 2026-09-17 user correction, an authorized author/admin edit response also prefills the stored bank account. The account remains editable and optional: unchanged or blank input preserves the stored account, while a new non-empty value replaces it. Reopening edit fetches the saved value; a background refetch never overwrites in-progress changes. Ordinary member list/detail responses continue hiding account data and edit queries use their separate cache context. A changed legacy participant list requires complete roster reselection. Every member-writable post edit launched from detail records the validated originating list; after a successful save, the edit and detail depth are dismissed together to restore that already-mounted list, including its participation group, filter, search/sort, and scroll state. Closing an edit without saving still returns to its existing detail, and direct edit entry without usable history replaces with a contextual detail. Administrator-authored boards, photo-album administration, and the admin console keep their existing navigation. A resource post moved between boards returns to its original list while the target board becomes authoritative. Detail supports image paging; account data on ordinary detail is rendered only for admins.

The admin console exposes one Board Management entry. It groups every board as All, Notices, Community/Resources, Participation, or Council, then selects an actual board and either Content or Settings. Board-type content editors stay in the selected board instead of navigating to separate notice, suggestion, mutual-aid, council-introduction, FAQ, or calendar sections. Existing slugs, categories, board types, privacy policies, and server-side admin authorization remain unchanged. `club-promo` and `networking-programs` cards additionally show the current representative-image thumbnail and allow an administrator to replace the first image attachment in place while preserving the post body, participation URL metadata, deadline, anonymity, and every other attachment. The administrator uploads through the existing media flow and submits only the resulting media ID to the dedicated representative-image endpoint; the operation never resubmits or revalidates unrelated post fields and requires no database schema change.

The admin console includes separate top-level `원우 명부` and `원우회비` tabs. `원우 명부` is a dense, paginated table searchable by name, student number, or major. Its headerless `이름, 전공, 학번` XLSX upserts identities by student number, overwrites changed name/major, inserts new students, retains omitted alumni, and never displays or changes payment state. `원우회비` shows every roster member with the derived current-term state. Its upload warning states that upload replaces the whole term; after full validation, all prior `ALL` and `ONCE` rows are cleared and the uploaded name/student-number matches become `ALL`. `납부 설정` keeps identity read-only and chooses `전체 납부`, one active activity-certification board for `1회 납부`, or `미납`; switching the board replaces the previous `ONCE`, and `미납` removes the payment row. Member-account cards do not display or mutate dues state. Visual evidence: `docs/qa/evidence/roster-dues-separation/admin-roster-table.png`, `admin-dues-payments.png`, and `activity-participant-colors.png`; verification matrix: `docs/qa/ROSTER_DUES_SEPARATION_2026-09-23.md`.

Council content is managed by admins except suggestion and mutual-aid submissions. The current-council route opens its single introduction directly, while cohort leaders and past councils use an admin-created summary list followed by a selected detail screen. All three member-facing detail views share an ordered organization-introduction photo gallery, greeting, and introduction; individual member profile cards are hidden because they have no detail action and duplicate the introduction. Cohort and past-council list summaries still use member data for the first name and `외 N명` count. The first `photo_urls[]` image is the representative image and mirrors `banner_image_url`; member rendering resolves `photo_urls[]`, then legacy `attachment_urls[]`, then `banner_image_url`. Admins can select multiple images, add images, delete an individual image, and move each image up or down; saving preserves the resulting order and mirrors its first image. Admins edit the single current-council introduction and can add, edit, reorder through list order, and delete cohort/past organization cards and all member cards; each member includes name, cohort, role, and an optional profile image. Notice create/edit can opt into council activity-history linkage; linked notices reuse their title, body, date, and image attachments in the council list and detail screens.

Mutual-aid lists and search results show member-readable request content with processing/completed/rejected status pills, require private evidence, allow the remarks field to be empty, and end creation on a dedicated completion screen. Ordinary member detail screens hide evidence. Per the 2026-09-17 user decision, the processing request author opens an authorized edit response that includes existing evidence thumbnails/filenames and proof links. The shared attachment editor supports opening, individual replacement/removal and adding private evidence; saving requires at least one file or valid proof link. Its calendar disables only dates before KST today, opens on the first selectable month when necessary, and maps `MUTUAL_AID_DATE_TOO_SOON` to the same guidance. Processing requests expose edit/delete, completed requests expose neither, and rejected requests expose delete only. A peer or non-processing requester guessing an evidence media ID receives the same not-found state as a missing object.
The admin console has a dedicated mutual-aid queue with processing/completed/rejected filters. Opening a request exposes the private evidence to admins and allows `processing`, `completed` (shown as `처리 완료`), or `rejected`; rejection requires a reason.
2026-10-06 user design update (WP5/WP9 P0): suggestion official replies show the plain `원우회 답변` heading without the decorative speech-bubble image.

Suggestion lists use `대기중` and `답변완료` status pills and preserve anonymous presentation. Per the 2026-10-07 user design update (WP5/WP9 P0), suggestion detail pills match the list: waiting background/text `#FAEEDA`/`#854F0B`, answered background/text `#EAF3DE`/`#3B6D11`. Both use regular 11px/13px text, 2px/8px padding and 8px radius. Creation ends on a dedicated completion screen. The admin console has a suggestion queue where admins open a suggestion and write the official reply; saving a reply marks it answered and notifies the author.
The admin console has a cohort-leader section for managing multiple cohorts, captain/vice-captain names, greeting, introduction, representative image, and profile images. The member council screen reads this structured metadata and keeps legacy post parsing only as a fallback.
Past councils and FAQ are separate admin sections. Past councils render a council-number list and member/activity detail tabs from `past_councils` metadata; FAQ renders from its dedicated API and table. Expanded FAQ answers render ordered protected image attachments at their natural aspect ratio.

2026-09-10 council menu override (WP5/WP9 P0 IA): remove the `원우회 활동내역` entry from the shared web/mobile Council hub. Retain the Council bottom tab and its other seven menu items, including Past Councils and their activity detail. Existing activity-history boards, posts, notice linkage, direct routes, and administrator management remain available; this change removes the member hub entry, not stored content.

Notification delivery surfaces:

- iOS/Android register an Expo push token using the EAS project ID; Android creates the `default` notification channel before permission/token requests.
- Web polls the authenticated notification API and can show the browser Notification API while the site is open after explicit browser permission.
- Closed-site background web push is not provided by `expo-notifications`; it requires a separate service worker, VAPID keys, and web-push provider.
- Logout deactivates the current native push token before clearing the session.

Required controls:

- Search input.
- Filter menu when board supports categories/status.
- Sort menu: latest, popular, views.
- Floating create button when user has write permission.

Presentation rules from the approved Figma capture set:

- 2026-09-17 viewer visual follow-up: remove the bottom zoom-in/out buttons, percentage, fit button, and gesture hint on web/native. Remove the footer entirely; keep pinch/double-tap zoom, web keyboard shortcuts, and photo paging, and use the freed space for the image.

- 2026-09-17 user override (WP5/WP9): community and participation post-detail images open a shared full-screen image modal instead of an external URL. This supersedes the 2026-09-12 no-viewer rule for photo albums, participation guides, and activity certifications; inline image frames and gallery navigation stay as designed. The selected image opens first, fitted to the viewport; pinch and buttons support 1–4x zoom, double tap toggles zoom/fit, zoomed dragging is bounded to image edges, and fitted horizontal swipes page within the post. Page changes reset the transform. Close/Esc/Android Back dismiss only the modal and retain the detail position. Club/networking guides include only detail images, excluding the list-only representative image. Notice images, including council-linked notices, remain inert. Document attachments and actual website links retain their existing opening behavior. Use the existing authorized signed-media access flow. Evidence: `docs/qa/IMAGE_VIEWER_2026-09-17.md`.
- 2026-09-24 user override (WP5/WP9): notice images (including council-linked notices shown in 원우회 활동내역), mutual-aid evidence images, and the shared council-introduction photo gallery (원우회 임원진 소개, 기수별 기장단 소개, 역대 원우회) now open the same shared image modal on tap. This supersedes the notice-inert rule above and the `tapping them does not open the source media` sentence below; notice frames stay 4:3/4:5 and still expose no `사진 전체보기` control. Mutual-aid evidence tiles keep their 96×96 placeholder look; only image evidence opens in the modal, while document evidence keeps external opening.

- 2026-09-12 comment/council follow-up (WP5/WP9 P0): dismiss the keyboard and remove input focus only after comment/reply registration succeeds; pending or failed submissions retain the composer. The current council introduction detail header always reads `원우회 임원진 소개`, including when its stored introduction title is `현재 원우회`. Introduction metadata, content, and administrator titles are retained.
- 2026-09-12 user override (WP5/WP9 P0): photo-album previous/next controls reuse the existing activity/council slider icons: a 28px circle with 35% black opacity and a white chevron. Multi-image visibility and current button geometry are preserved. The closed My Page drawer must not overlay any photo-button touch area; both album buttons retain their full 44px hit width. (The leftmost-24px drag observation described here was removed on 2026-09-21 — see below.) Participation and album images do not expose a full-view button or viewer, including when legacy activity metadata has `expandable: true`. See `docs/qa/GALLERY_TOUCH_AND_FULL_VIEW_2026-09-12.md`.
- Community, notice, My Posts/Scrap, council, mutual-aid, and activity-feed dates use `YY.MM.DD(weekday)` in Korean, calculated in `Asia/Seoul`.
- Comment metadata appends `· N분 전` for activity under one hour and `· HH:mm` afterward.
- Activity-certification date inputs, feeds, and details use `YY.MM.DD(weekday)`. Per the 2026-10-06 user update (WP5/WP9 P0), club, study and networking certification feeds always display the post creation date (`created_at`). Activity-date inputs and detail content continue to use the selected activity date.
- Schedule day headers use `YY.MM.DD(weekday)`, rows use `HH:mm`, and schedule detail metadata uses `YY.MM.DD(weekday) · HH:mm`.
- Home schedule summaries use `MM.DD(weekday)`.
- Home notice metadata uses `학사공지`, `행사공지`, or `기타공지`; webinar and special-lecture aliases are presented as `행사공지`, and raw codes such as `other` are never shown.
- Home banners are image-only assets registered by an administrator. The app renders the selected responsive image without synthesized title, badge, description, deadline, theme overlay, or gradient; only the carousel page indicator and optional navigation link remain app UI.
- Notice-detail images use the available full width and exactly two orientation frames: landscape, square, and unreadable images use `4:3` (`320x240` at the approved 360px screen baseline), while portrait images use `4:5` (`320x400`). Images use `contain` so the full source remains visible; mismatched ratios use the frame background as letterboxing. Notice images do not expose a `사진 전체보기` control and tapping them does not open the source media. Notice file and link attachments remain interactive. Administrator-managed participation-guide images retain their existing orientation frames. Activity-certification feed thumbnails use the Figma feed-card image frame (`328x219` at the approved 360px baseline, the card width after its 16px side margins), replacing the earlier `2.05:1` frame that was 59px shorter at the same width. Each activity-certification board can independently configure its detail gallery under admin board settings: a required default rule and optional landscape/portrait overrides control maximum width, natural or fixed height, optional maximum height, `contain`/`cover`. Landscape or portrait overrides win when present; square and unreadable source dimensions use the default. Missing or invalid metadata follows the approved Figma baseline at full available width: default and portrait images use a fixed 400px `contain` frame, landscape images use a fixed 240px `contain` frame, with no full-view control or viewer. Legacy `expandable` metadata is accepted for compatibility but does not enable a viewer. Photo albums alone retain the fixed `240px` hero frame. Club-activity feed previews show the first non-empty content row directly below the club tag, including legacy template rows labeled `[동아리명] :` or `[동아리 명] :`, while other activity feeds keep their existing text.
- Notification rows are an explicit exception: today's items use `오전/오후 h:mm`, and older rows use `YY.MM.DD` without a weekday.
- QA 153: lecture-review bookmarks in My Activity render only `YY.MM.DD(weekday)`; they omit `Anonymous`, cohort, and the author/date separator. Other bookmark metadata is unchanged.
- Council activity-history rows contain date and title only; their detail contains title, divider, and body without reactions or comments.
- Mutual-aid member list status labels are `처리중`, `완료`, and `반려`.

States:

- Loading skeleton.
- Empty state.
- Error state with retry.
- Guest write attempt routes to login.

## 5. Post Detail Requirements

Required sections:

- Title.
- Board/category metadata.
- Author display, respecting anonymous rules.
- Body.
- Attachments.
- Like/bookmark actions for logged-in users.
- Comments and replies.
- Selecting a top-level comment reply shows a compact composer target using the same visible `cohort + author` label followed by `님에게 답글`. The target strip never exposes the internal parent comment ID or `작성 중`; reply mode uses `답글을 남겨보세요`, and cancel or successful submission restores the ordinary comment composer.
- Root comments use thin dividers and two-depth replies use indented rounded neutral rows. Every comment keeps a right-aligned `신고` entry; owner rows place the applicable `답글`, `수정`, and `삭제` text actions on one compact line. Edit mode replaces the content with a primary-blue bordered field and shows only `저장` and `취소`.
- Post and comment reports use one bottom sheet with the ordered reasons `스팸/광고입니다`, `욕설 및 비방이 포함되어 있어요`, `허위 정보예요`, and `기타`. Selecting `기타` reveals the multiline detail field and requires nonblank detail before submission. Owner post/comment report attempts are blocked locally with explanatory feedback and never send a report request.
- Header and Android hardware Back close an open post/comment report sheet or More menu before leaving post detail. Delete confirmations consume Back too: close a cancellable confirmation and clear comment-deletion errors, but stay put while deletion is pending. Only unobscured detail uses the existing history/validated-list return policy, preventing dismissed sheets from reappearing on return.
- Edit/delete actions for owner/admin. Destructive comment confirmation is rendered in-app so the delete request works consistently on native and web.
- Post and comment delete confirmations use centered rounded cards, neutral `취소`, destructive `삭제`, and explicit irreversible-deletion copy consistent with the approved mobile reference.
- Pin action for admin.

Resource-board exceptions:

- `lecture-reviews` keeps forced-anonymous presentation for the post author and supports comments; comment rows show the commenter's cohort/author like other boards.
- `exam-archive` shows the cohort/author and supports comments as shown in the latest approved Figma capture.
- Comment rows display `cohort + author`, content, and `YY.MM.DD(weekday) · N분 전` for recent comments or `YY.MM.DD(weekday) · HH:mm` afterward. After account deletion, the writing-time author/cohort snapshot remains visible; only historical orphan rows without any snapshot use `Deleted user`.

## 6. Create/Edit Requirements

Android system Back and the create/edit header share the same origin-aware return decision. Creating from Community > Resources returns to the mounted Resources list with its selected category, without emitting a bottom-tab reset. Open board/date selectors close first; native Modal sheets retain their own close handlers. Registered completion takes precedence over retained form selector state and uses its existing confirmation destination. The Android listener is removed on blur. See `docs/qa/RESOURCE_CREATE_BACK_ANDROID_2026-09-10.md`.

Required fields:

- Title.
- Content, except optional mutual-aid remarks.
- Attachments when supported.
- Anonymous option when board allows.
- Type-specific metadata.
- Club guide metadata: administrator-managed participation URL.

Required behavior:

- Local draft autosave is a deferred P1/v1.1 item and is not required for the Phase 5 entry gate.
- Validate required title and content while allowing mutual-aid remarks to remain empty.
- For mutual-aid creation, accept `Asia/Seoul` today or later and reject past dates. Recompute the boundary at submission time; do not rely only on disabled calendar cells.
- Prevent duplicate submit.
- Show upload progress when attachments exist.

## 7. Auth Screens

Login:

- Email.
- Password.
- Login button.
- Register link.
- Password reset link.

Register:

- Step 1: school email verification.
- Step 2: six-digit email verification code.
- Step 3: name/nickname, cohort, active major, phone, password/confirmation, and current privacy-policy consent.
- Major options and privacy-policy version come from the public registration-options API and are managed by admins.
- The privacy checkbox toggles consent directly. Only the right chevron opens the combined terms-and-privacy document assembled from the same canonical sections used by the My Page terms and privacy screens, and the sheet can close at any scroll position. Signup still requires explicit consent to the active privacy-policy version.

Password reset:

- Email request.
- Reset token confirmation.
- New password.

Find ID decision:

- Email is the only login ID, so v1 does not add a separate ID-discovery API or screen.
- Login and recovery copy should direct the user to their `@sogang.ac.kr` email and password reset.

## 8. Settings Screens

Profile:

- Name/nickname and cohort are read-only identity fields.
- Major is selected from currently active administrator-managed options.
- Phone.
- Company/job fields if retained.
- Profile image.

Notifications:

- Comment.
- Like.
- Notice.
- Event.

Account:

- Password change.
- Logout.
- Irreversible account deletion with current-password input, explicit acknowledgement, error recovery, and completed-session cleanup. After an authenticated deletion, the explicit `completed=1` state uses the compact approved completion UI (`탈퇴가 완료되었어요!`, `확인`) and returns to login without exposing the protected settings stack.

Public account deletion:

- The guest route first requests a six-digit school-email code without disclosing whether the account exists.
- Verification requires email, code, current password, and the exact destructive-action confirmation phrase.
- The page distinguishes request, verification, and completion states, but intentionally does not distinguish unknown account, wrong code, or wrong password errors.
- The copy states that private/draft/hidden/mutual-aid content and private data are deleted, while retained public published content is disconnected from the author.
- The same route distinguishes completion sources: authenticated `completed=1` uses the compact in-app completion state, while public email-code deletion keeps the detailed retention explanation and login/privacy links.

My activity:

- My posts.
- My comments.
- Bookmarks.
- Header and Android hardware Back use the shared drawer return: one press restores the original My Page drawer without replacing the activity route with another Settings index. Repeated visits preserve the selected `posts`, `comments`, or `bookmarks` query and do not accumulate duplicate My Page screens. Closing the restored drawer reveals its remembered main tab. Android evidence: `docs/qa/MY_ACTIVITY_BACK_ANDROID_2026-09-10.md`.

My Page drawer return and avatar:
- 2026-09-21 user request (WP5/WP9): the app defines no navigation swipe gestures of its own, while each platform's built-in gesture stays as-is. Both My Page drawer PanResponders are removed — the left-edge drag that opened it and the leftward drag that closed it — so `MyPageDrawer` registers no gesture handlers at all. The drawer opens from the Home header's My Page button and closes from its own close button or, on Android, the system Back that the overlay Modal consumes. iOS keeps its built-in interactive pop on every stack; no `gestureEnabled: false` is set anywhere, and it must not be added back. The original defect was that the drawer's JS PanResponder claimed the same zone as iOS's native recognizer (leftmost ~25pt) and could not arbitrate against it, so an edge swipe non-deterministically popped the screen, opened the drawer, or did both and left the drawer floating over an unrelated screen; removing the app's own gesture resolves it. Android's `predictiveBackGestureEnabled: false` policy and BackHandler ordering are untouched, and non-navigational horizontal swipes (Home banner carousel, full-screen image viewer paging) are unaffected.
- 2026-09-21 swipe parity (WP5/WP9): an iOS swipe now runs the same return logic as the header and Android Back on the screens where Back is not a plain pop, using React Navigation 7's `usePreventRemove`, which makes `native-stack` set `preventNativeDismiss` so the native gesture itself is held. Post create/edit prevent removal while the form has unsaved changes and no completed post, show `DiscardWriteModal`, and on confirm release the lock and then replay the original navigation action, so a swipe no longer drops a draft. The four My Page settings screens always prevent removal and run the existing drawer return instead, so a swipe restores the drawer over its origin tab rather than popping to `/settings/index`. The header button and Android `BackHandler` paths are unchanged and still take their existing route; only gesture-initiated removals replay the captured action.
- Remaining gap (2026-09-21): board list, post detail, event detail, event day, FAQ, and search still handle Back only through `BackHandler`, so an iOS swipe there performs a plain pop and skips their close-first ordering (keyboard, sort menu, inline search) and validated `returnTo`. These screens lose no user input, so they are left as-is. Tag: `Phase 5 QA`.

- QA 145-147: when the drawer opens, it records the mounted Home, Notices, Community, Participation, or Council origin. Entering Profile, Notifications, Account, or My Activity keeps the drawer covering the origin until the focused settings screen has laid out and had a paint opportunity. Header Back and Android hardware Back first show the full drawer, then explicitly reactivate the mounted origin underneath it; unrelated settings history is ignored, and Home is used only without a valid origin. Reactivating the mounted tab preserves its nested list, filters, search/sort, and scroll state. These handoffs do not slide the drawer away or reopen it over an exposed origin; explicit close retains its slide. Profile-save navigation remains unchanged. See `docs/qa/MY_PAGE_TRANSITIONS_ANDROID_2026-09-10.md` for Android execution and final packaged QA scope.
- QA 148: a positive integer profile media ID or trimmed nonempty profile URL renders the profile image. Missing, blank, or invalid media renders `DefaultAvatarIcon`; no nickname initial, `?`, or other character fallback is rendered inside the avatar.

## 9. Design Gate

2026-10-07 dashboard simplification (WP8/WP9): the user requested removal of the lower dashboard area beginning with operating shortcuts. `/admin/dashboard` now ends after the daily post/comment tables; the duplicate cumulative statistics, recent operations and recent-post cards are no longer rendered there. Daily metrics, date controls, seven-day traffic and table pagination remain. Management is reachable through the existing dedicated tabs, and the native administrator screen retains its existing operations.

2026-10-07 WP8/WP9 member management: `/admin/accounts` is labeled `회원 관리`
and uses the main console's white table, compact buttons and underline filters.
Name/email/cohort search and active/inactive filtering use server pagination (20
per page). A right-side editor updates name, cohort, active registration major,
contact and existing enrollment/account status together. Per the follow-up,
company/affiliation, job and position inputs are absent from the web editor;
their existing stored values and backend fields remain intact.
Email is read-only; role-switching is removed from this web screen. Consent and
recent-login records remain readable. Failed saves retain drafts; close/sidebar/
reload protect unsaved changes, and pending saves lock sidebar navigation. The
editor lives in the persistent admin layout, so browser Back between admin pages
keeps the drawer and draft open even when the background route changes. Native
legacy administration remains available. Defaults and evidence are recorded in
`docs/qa/ADMIN_MEMBERS_WEB_2026-10-07.md`.

2026-10-07 dues theme continuation (WP8/WP9 P0): web `/admin/dues` follows the
white main/member/roster theme. Search/upload share a wrapping toolbar; ordinary
payment management and existing individual one-time registration are underline
tabs. A 100-row paginated table exposes name/student number/major, payment scope,
linked activity board and the existing setting/registration action. Neutral
guidance and the styled confirmation retain the complete current-term replacement
warning; original import, validation, save and feedback handlers remain. The
white payment editor keeps read-only identity and all three payment scopes plus
the activity-board picker; its footer remains visible while web content scrolls.
Native presentation and backend contracts remain. Evidence:
`docs/qa/ADMIN_DUES_WEB_2026-10-07.md`.

2026-10-07 roster theme continuation (WP8/WP9 P0): web `/admin/roster` follows the
main/member-management white theme. Search and workbook upload share a wrapping
toolbar, neutral two-line guidance retains headerless XLSX column order and
upsert/omission behavior, and the existing shared table uses name/student-number/
major columns with 100-row server pagination. Empty/loading/error states appear
inside the table; errors offer retry and search offers reset. The existing import,
cache invalidation and success/error dialogs are retained. No inline identity or
payment editor is added. Native retains its original view. Evidence:
`docs/qa/ADMIN_ROSTER_WEB_2026-10-07.md`.

2026-10-07 member-password continuation (WP8/WP9 P0): the same white member drawer
adds an on-demand `비밀번호 관리` section with masked new-password and confirmation
inputs. `비밀번호 변경` validates the existing policy/matching values, then confirms
the named member before calling the separate protected reset API. Profile saving
remains separate. Password drafts participate in unsaved close/reload protection;
confirmation and mutation block competing leave actions. A self-reset requires
pending profile changes to be saved first and routes to login after clearing the
session. Failures retain input; success clears password inputs and refreshes
member/operating-record/main queries. Passwords are never placed in query caches
or persisted as drafts. No new screen or native changes.

2026-10-07 banner refinement (WP8/WP9 P0): `/admin/banners` retains its controller/form and protected APIs. Web exposure bounds use date/time pickers in KST with minute precision; empty start/end retain unlimited bounds and invalid/reversed intervals block save. Editing converts API UTC timestamps into KST; saves convert KST to UTC. Destination selection now searches published posts across boards with board filter and 10-row pagination; the existing direct-link field remains under an expandable control. White section/list styling follows the admin main, and device-specific images, uploads/URLs, hide, order, active state and preview remain.

2026-10-07 WP8/WP9 continuation: the user authorized implementing all existing admin tabs immediately with provisional defaults. A protected `/admin/_layout` owns the persistent controller and white sidebar/header. Canonical pages: `/admin`, `/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/banners`, `/admin/boards`, `/admin/accounts`, `/admin/roster`, `/admin/dues`, `/admin/reports`, `/admin/registration`, `/admin/audit-logs`, `/admin/migration-review`. Root section aliases, scope and event-edit links stay valid; automatic resolution retains event parameters and explicit navigation cancels deferred intents. Admin post detail/create/edit reuse current workflows at `/admin/boards/post/:id`, `/admin/boards/create`, `/admin/boards/post/:id/edit`, with Back/completion inside administration. Sidebar/member exit honor the write-leave guard. Member frames/routes and native behavior remain available. Dashboard day/trend/drilldown now use a protected API; old cumulative statistics and commands remain. Defaults/evidence: `docs/qa/ADMIN_PAGES_DECISIONS_2026-10-07.md`. This supersedes the pending dashboard/editor scope in the initial main note below.

2026-10-07 admin main (WP8/WP9): web `/admin` defaults to `main`; existing sections use `/admin?section=...` and the current Expo route rather than introducing a separate web app. The white desktop sidebar and header reuse Pretendard/shared colors. Only authorized `/admin` web paths escape the root 405px member frame; member routes and native layouts retain their current behavior. Main shows seven statistics, pending summaries, independently paginated mutual-aid/suggestion queues and five recent audit records. Request details/processing open in a right panel; full lists, existing dashboard and other editors remain reachable. KST midnight, focus and periodic refetch update daily data; cached handled rows are also removed locally at midnight when the refresh fails. Main numbers currently open the existing dashboard; seven-day trends and metric/date drilldown remain the next dashboard slice. Full operational records paginate through the existing audit API. The requested main guidance, bottom quick actions and utilization button are absent. Clear legacy event-edit/scope parameters on explicit sidebar navigation to avoid replaying an old edit intent. Evidence: `docs/qa/ADMIN_MAIN_WEB_2026-10-07.md`.

2026-10-01 typography compatibility (WP9 P0): app-owned text and inputs use `AppText` / `AppTextInput` from `components/AppTypography.tsx`. Each logical weight selects a static Pretendard face (400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900) with native/web `fontWeight: normal`; 100-300 fall back to Regular. Nested text inherits the logical weight and can override it, explicit custom font families remain usable, and input refs expose the native instance. The root loads six assets with `useFonts` before showing navigation. Header/tab labels set the same family explicitly, and web smoothing remains enabled. Do not patch React Native component internals: RN 0.81 Text/TextInput have no `.render` property. Runtime and verification evidence: `docs/qa/TYPOGRAPHY_WEB_ANDROID_2026-10-01.md`.

Before frontend expansion, Figma should provide:

- Colors.
- Typography.
- Button/input/card/list item components.
- Home.
- Login/register/password reset.
- Board list.
- Post detail.
- Create/edit.
- Calendar.
- FAQ.
- Settings/profile.
- Search.

- 2026-09-17 attachment editing (WP5/WP9 P0): all four resource categories and retained generic community edits display existing image/document rows with thumbnail/name, open, change and delete actions, plus photo/file add actions. Generic member create reuses the editor; specialized activity/album/guide flows keep their current rules. Pending edits are local until save; cancelled/failed replacement preserves the old item and order. Web document opening uses the existing signed download endpoint (`Content-Disposition: attachment`) to preserve the form without a popup, and images use the existing modal. Mutual-aid evidence uses private uploads and explicit replacement IDs/proof field. Edit queries fetch current server data before one-time hydration; later refetches do not overwrite a draft. Account changes replace the root cache and mounted forms.
- 2026-09-21 attachment limits (WP5/WP9): the client restricts generic attachments to the four types the UI advertises (`JPG`, `JPEG`, `PNG`, `PDF`, `DOCX`) and pre-checks size against the same 10 MiB limit the server enforces, so rejected files never leave the device. The server's `MEDIA_ALLOWED_*` allowlist is intentionally left wider (HWP/ZIP/TXT/IPYNB/GIF/WEBP/HEIC) and keeps accepting existing attachments; only the app narrows. Mutual-aid evidence keeps its narrower JPEG/PNG list. Native and web pickers both filter by the same list and re-check the resolved content type after selection, since a picker filter alone is advisory. A multi-file document selection is rejected as a whole when any file fails, so a partial upload never happens. Upload failures no longer render inline text inside the attachment editor: the editor reports the error to its host screen, which maps it with `uploadFailureFeedback` — oversize to `Component/Toast-ImageSizeError`, wrong format to `Component/Toast-FileFormatError`, rate limit to `Screen/Common/RateLimitModal`, and every other cause, including a failed file open, to `Screen/Common/UploadFailModal`. The post edit screen gained the toast and notice modal it previously lacked.

- 2026-09-17 notice wording correction (WP6/WP9): the notice tab and Home notice summaries share deadline formatting. Upcoming notices display `마감 D-N`, same-day notices display `마감 D-day`, and past/invalid/missing deadlines add no suffix. Expired notices show only their publication date, without a standalone `마감` label or empty separator. Schedule-card status labels keep their separate existing policy.

- 2026-09-17 WP5/WP9 club operation setting: administrator club create/edit forms expose `운영 중 / 운영 종료` independently of recruitment state. Missing legacy state defaults to `운영 중`. A recruitment-closed club remains selectable while operating. Operation-ended clubs disappear from new certification source choices, including source changes during edit, while an existing historical selection stays readable/editable. All source pages are loaded before filtering; an ended-only page cannot hide active clubs on later pages. Saving a guide invalidates the source-option cache along with its board posts.

2026-10-07 WP8/WP9 board console: `/admin/boards` on web uses a white left
taxonomy rail (원우회, 참여활동, 커뮤니티, 공지사항) and a right content area.
Current resource/participation/notice tags filter a 10-row post table; no
board finder is displayed. Settings, board creation and the existing notice
editor open on demand. Actual notice boards/custom children remain selectable
under collapsed settings; older boards stay under additional management,
uncategorized boards under other boards, inactive boards under hidden boards.
Create selects group, section and optional parent, supporting nested children.
Deletion is recoverable branch hiding; restore is individual, parent first.
Existing intro, FAQ, external-link, suggestion, mutual-aid and calendar
controls remain reachable. Newly created intro/FAQ children default to normal
post boards because the existing dedicated editors target canonical content.
Unsaved create/notice/settings drafts confirm navigation; pending operations
lock navigation. Native uses the existing view and existing admin post
detail/create/edit routes are preserved. Evidence:
`docs/qa/ADMIN_BOARDS_WEB_2026-10-07.md`.

2026-10-07 board theme continuation (WP8/WP9 P0): the web board workspace
scopes `AdminBoardWebTheme` around its subcategory filters and existing
editors. Filters use a white row with a selected blue underline; section
titles, policy rows, request/FAQ rows and compact actions follow the main
console. Context defaults preserve the existing shared-control presentation
outside this web workspace, including native. No routes, fields, mutations
or authorization contracts change.

2026-10-07 participation management continuation (WP8/WP9 P0): club and
networking sections always show their canonical, active guide registration
action (`동아리 등록` / `네트워킹 행사 등록`) separately from `활동 인증 보기`.
Selecting a section without a sub-board prefers its guide board for settings,
regardless of certification sort order. The guide filters read `동아리 목록` /
`행사 목록`. Selecting the certification board retains `활동 인증 작성`, and
custom children retain their existing create actions. Hidden/missing guide
boards never fall back to registering on the certification board. Both guide
create/edit forms now expose the existing operation status: active targets
are selectable for new certifications, ended targets are excluded and existing
certifications remain editable. Legacy missing status defaults to active;
recruitment closure remains independent. Existing URL data, media requirements,
paired source validation and admin-only guide authorization are preserved.
Evidence: `docs/qa/ADMIN_PARTICIPATION_WEB_2026-10-07.md`.

2026-10-07 participation link deferral (WP8/WP9 P0): per “참여버튼링크는
없어도돼 그건 차후”, club/networking guide create/edit forms omit the
application URL input, required checks and URL-entry guidance. New guides
save only operation status and other existing metadata; edits preserve
stored URL metadata without resubmitting an empty URL. The API accepts
link-free guides while validating non-empty URLs from existing clients.
Title/content/image requirements, operation status, certification links,
historical records and backend administrator permissions remain.

## Network Failure Presentation

2026-10-07 all-screen update (WP5/WP9 P0), superseding section-only presentation: both shared API clients report connection failures/timeouts to one app-wide state. The root navigator remains mounted under a single white, centered `AppNetworkError` overlay, covering authenticated, authentication, administrator and legal/support routes while the outage is known. Detection follows an actual failed API request; there is no platform connectivity polling. Retry first probes the existing `/health` endpoint, then refreshes active query reads and focused legacy load callbacks. Do not automatically replay mutations/uploads. Disable repeated retry taps while recovery runs, retain the overlay when a new connection failure occurs during recovery, and preserve form drafts and the session on refresh-token connection failure. HTTP errors and cancelled requests retain their existing handling. Native overlay stacking and physical offline/recovery checks remain `Phase 5 QA`.

2026-10-06 user design update (WP5/WP9 P0): read/load failures in Home sections, Notices, community/participation/council hubs, board lists (including cohort leaders and council activity), post detail/edit, certification edit, FAQ, search, notifications, My Activity, My Page/profile and notification settings use `components/NetworkErrorState.tsx` when Axios receives no response due to a connection failure or timeout. Keep HTTP response errors, validation and cancelled requests on their existing paths. This is a UI change; API retry/session policies and mutation error flows are unchanged.

Match `Screen/Common/NetworkError`: white full-width responsive container, 218px minimum height; red `#D64545` 35px Wi-Fi glyph centered in a 48px frame; title `네트워크 연결이 원활하지 않아요` (500, 16px/19px), followed after 6px by `인터넷 연결 상태를 확인한 후 다시 시도해주세요` (400, 13px/16px, `#6B7280`). Leave 16px after the icon and 24px before the blue `#2761FF` retry button (100×48px, 8px radius, 500 14px/17px white label `다시 시도`). Preserve each screen's existing navigation and connect the button to its own refetch/load callback. Notices show one initial network state rather than duplicating it with the empty-list placeholder.


2026-10-06 shared board search design update (WP5/WP9 P0): photo-album, participation certification and community inline search inputs show the same 18px `close-circle` clear icon (`#A6ACB7`) as notice search when the draft is non-empty. Clearing removes both draft and submitted keywords, returns the feed to its unfiltered state, and keeps search mode open. Keep the input flexible with `minWidth: 0` so long text cannot push the clear control outside its row.


2026-10-06 cohort introduction photo-count update (WP5/WP9 P0): the shared council introduction photo slider displays current/total count for every non-empty gallery, including `1 / 1` for one photo. The lower-right overlay matches the album counter (17px right/bottom, 40% black, 4px/10px padding, white regular 12px/14px text) without intercepting touches. Navigation arrows remain limited to multiple photos.


2026-10-07 attachment design update (WP5/WP9 P0): the shared attachment editor omits the standalone `파일을 업로드하고 있어요.` status line in both ordinary and private-evidence variants. Existing uploading button labels and disabled states remain active.


2026-10-07 mutual-aid status chip alignment (WP5/WP9 P0): member detail and list chips match the supplied design. Processing uses `#E6F1FB`/`#0C447C`, completed `#EAF3DE`/`#3B6D11`, rejected `#FBEAF0`/`#993556` (background/text). Per the subsequent 2026-10-07 user detail-state-chip reference, list tags retain regular 11px/13px text, 2px/8px padding and 8px radius, while detail chips use Medium 12px/14px text, 5px/10px padding and 999px radius. Detail design targets are 52×24px for processing and 41×24px for rejected; widths follow text content. Completed uses the same detail geometry with its green tone.
