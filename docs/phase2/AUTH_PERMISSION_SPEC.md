# Phase 2 Auth and Permission Spec

2026-07-05 override: `정책_정의서_260705.pdf` changes the launch access model to a member-only app. `guest` users may use login, signup/email verification, password reset, public account-deletion request/verify, token refresh, registration options, legal/support screens, and health/docs only. Board, post, comment, search, event, FAQ, media, banner, notification, settings, and admin APIs require an authenticated user unless a later policy document explicitly re-opens a public route. A signed media file URL is a short-lived capability issued only after an authenticated authorization check.

Status: implemented baseline, checked 2026-07-27

## 1. Roles

| Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `guest` | Not logged in |
| `user` | Verified active student/alumni user |
| `admin` | Student council/admin operator |

Role hierarchy:

`admin` includes `user` permissions.

## 2. Session Strategy

Use:

- Short-lived JWT access token.
- Long-lived opaque refresh token stored hashed in DB.
- Refresh-token rotation on every refresh.
- Logout revokes refresh token.

Recommended expiry:

- Access token: 15 minutes.
- Refresh token: 30 days.
- Email verification code and resend cooldown: 5 minutes.
- Password reset token: 30 minutes.

## 3. Password Rules

Minimum:

- 8 characters.
- Include at least one ASCII letter, one number, and one special character.

Recommended:

- Reject common leaked passwords later.
- New and changed passwords use Argon2id.
- Existing PBKDF2 hashes remain readable and are upgraded to Argon2id after a successful login.

## 4. School Email Rules

Allowed domains:

- `sogang.ac.kr`

Implementation:

- Domain check is case-insensitive.
- Send a six-digit numeric verification code.
- Store only code hash.
- Never include verification or reset codes in API responses or client-visible development fields.
- Expire codes and block verification after five failed attempts.
- Rate limit request by email and IP.
- Registration requires the currently active administrator-managed major option.
- Registration requires the current privacy-policy version and stores both the accepted version and consent timestamp on the user.

## 6. Board Write Policy

`boards.write_permission` values:

- `guest`: public write. Avoid in Phase 2.
- `user`: verified users.
- `admin`: admins only.

Rules:

- Backend must enforce this, not frontend only.
- Frontend may hide buttons based on permission, but hidden UI is not security.
- The `club-promo` and `networking-programs` boards are seeded and migrated with `write_permission = admin`; the post API also applies an explicit admin guard for defense in depth.
- `study-recruit` and all activity certification boards remain user-writable. Activity bank-account metadata is sensitive and may be read only by admins.
- Activity-certification participants are resolved only from the independent current dues-payer roster. Member-account enrollment, activation, and legacy dues fields grant no participant eligibility. Only admins may list the full roster, import XLSX rows, or permanently clear it; authenticated members receive bounded name/student-number search results for the picker.
- Every `council`/`gsa` board is admin-writable unless its board type is `suggestion` or `mutual_aid`.
- Cohort-leader registration is stored through the admin-only board management API; members can read the configured cohort introductions but cannot create or edit them.
- Past-council records use a separate admin-only board metadata area. FAQ remains a separate dedicated table/API; neither mutation path is available to members.
- Suggestions remain anonymous in member and admin presentation. Only the admin reply endpoint can set an official answer and `answered` requires reply text.
- Mutual-aid submission content and status are readable by authenticated members. Evidence files, evidence filenames, and `metadata.proof_url` are never returned to non-admin clients; direct evidence media lookup returns `404 NOT_FOUND`.
- A requester may edit a mutual-aid submission only while it is `processing`. They may delete a `processing` or `rejected` submission, but never a `completed` submission; the API enforces the state rule even when called directly.
- Draft and hidden posts are author/admin only across the same paths, while `deleted` status is admin-only; changing a previously readable post to an unpublished state removes it from other members' activity history and media authorization.
- The backend does not mount the upload directory. It issues short-lived signed media URLs only after an authenticated metadata/access request passes object-level policy. Ordinary post attachments inherit post read policy; mutual-aid evidence is administrator-only even for the requester after attachment.

## 7. Anonymous Writing

Rules:

- Allowed only when `boards.allow_anonymous = true`.
- Store real `author_id`.
- Return `author_id = null`, `author_nickname = "Anonymous"`, and no cohort to non-admin readers other than the author when `is_anonymous = true` or the board forces anonymous presentation. The author may receive their own ID for edit/delete controls, but their displayed name stays anonymous.
- Non-admin author-name search never matches an anonymous post. Author blocking is not applied to anonymous or forced-anonymous posts because appearance/disappearance would reveal identity; those posts remain reportable.
- Admins can still see moderation identity if needed.
- An anonymized account-deletion author is different from an anonymous post. After deletion the real user row no longer exists, `author_id` is null for retained public content, and every reader sees `Deleted user`; administrators cannot recover the deleted identity from the content row.

## 8. Comment Depth

Notion scope says 2-depth comments.

Rules:

- Root comment: `parent_id = null`.
- Reply: `parent_id` points to root comment.
- Reply to reply is rejected with `BAD_REQUEST`.

## 9. Backend Dependencies

Required FastAPI dependencies:

- `get_current_user_optional() -> User | None`
- `get_current_user() -> User`
- `require_admin() -> User`
- `require_post_owner_or_admin(post_id) -> User`
- `require_comment_owner_or_admin(comment_id) -> User`
- `require_board_write_permission(board_id) -> User`

Remove:

- Fixed `CURRENT_USER_ID = 1` for write operations.

## 10. Frontend Auth State

Store:

- `accessToken`
- `refreshToken`
- `user`
- `isAuthenticated`

Rules:

- Attach access token through Axios interceptor.
- On 401, attempt one refresh.
- If refresh fails, clear auth state and route to login.
- Logout clears local state and calls backend logout when possible.

## 11. Login Identifier Recovery

- The school email is the login ID.
- v1 does not expose a separate "find ID" API because it would duplicate the email identifier and could enable account enumeration.
- Users who know their school email use the password-reset flow; login/help copy explains this decision.

## 12. Account Deletion Security

- Authenticated deletion uses `DELETE /api/users/me` and requires the current password in the request body.
- Signed-out deletion uses `POST /api/auth/account-deletion/request` followed by `/verify`; verification requires the school-email code and current password.
- The request endpoint returns the same accepted response for existing and missing accounts. Invalid account, code, or password at verification returns one generic error.
- Both paths are rate-limited. Verification codes are hashed, have attempt and expiry limits, and are never returned by the API or logged.
- The operation hard-deletes account PII, sessions/tokens, user-specific activity, and unattached owned uploads in one database transaction with staged-file rollback protection.
- Every authored post/comment remains regardless of status or board type. Before the user row is removed, missing writing-time name/cohort snapshots are filled and `author_id` is cleared. Every connected owned media asset remains with its `owner_id` cleared; filenames and bytes are unchanged.
- Anonymous and forced-anonymous content remains anonymous to non-admin readers. Administrators may resolve its live author or historical snapshot. Mutual-aid evidence remains administrator-only after account deletion.
- Administrators must transfer operational responsibility and be demoted by another administrator before self-deletion.
- The completion receipt is deliberately non-identifying. There is no fixed application-level legal retention claim; any receipt or backup interval requires explicit privacy-owner approval.
